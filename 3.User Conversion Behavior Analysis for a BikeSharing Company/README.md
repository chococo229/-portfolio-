# User Conversion Behavior Analysis for a Bike Sharing Company
## A statement of business task
The business task is to increase profitability by converting casual users into annual members. To achieve this, we will analyze the behavioral differences between casual users and annual members to identify key usage patterns. Based on these insights, we can design targeted campaigns and incentives to enhance conversion rates andencourage long-term membership.

## Top 3 recommendations
**Introduce a Weekend Membership Plan**
Consider offering a “Weekend Pass” or a discounted weekend membership, which provides unlimited
rides on Saturdays and Sundays.
**Incentivize Long-Distance Riders**
Consider implementing a mileage-based rewards program. Riders could earn points based on the total
distance traveled, which can be redeemed for discounts on membership upgrades.
**Offer a Promotion Plan for Specific High-Usage Stations**
Identify high-traffic station areas for casual users, and consider offering a special pricing on an annual
membership which is valid for rides starting from that zone.

## Key findings
**1. Riding Patterns by User Type**
Annual members primarily use bikes on weekdays, while casual users are more likely to ride on weekends.This suggests that casual riders tend to use bike for leisure rather than commuting.

**2. Trip Duration Difference**
The average trip duration for casual users is significantly longer than that of annual members. This may indicate that casual riders often choose bikes for longer trips, whereas annual members use them for routine commutes, leading to more consistent trip durations.
